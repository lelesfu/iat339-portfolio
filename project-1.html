                <p>project is intended to bring awareness towards the impact society has on global warming.</p>
                <br>
                <p>In this team project, we studied the reasons for the melting of glaciers in recent years and provided information that can increase people â€™s awareness towards the impact society has on global warming in an interactive and innovative way. My role in the project is to conduct research and propose ways to present the ideas we want to convey to the target audience through interactive design.</p>

              <h3>Analysis</h3>
              <p>As an interaction designer in the team, I did a lot of research and interaction case analysis, The first case is Melting Men of Nele Azevedo. She designed this work in 2009. Although the work does not use any modern technology to interact with users, it provides me with a very clear meaning and goal: to let people Observe global warming by observing the temperature of the earth. The process of melting the ice man. In addition to observation, people can interact with the artwork by putting the ice man in place. The second example that inspired me was the Penguins Mirror designed by Daniel Rozin in 2015. He used 450 plush penguins and modern technologies such as Kinect sensors to interact with users. I am very interested because it is for the following users Provides rich interactive high-tech help. The user can perform various actions to interact with the artwork. In addition, it provides users with an opportunity to consider the meaning of penguin filling, which for me reminds me of the global warming penguins are suffering from. So, I decide to follow his idea about disclosing the severity of global warming, and using Kinect sensor as a technology to achieve the interactions.</p><br>
              <p>
              In this project, I learned how to create interactions using case analysis that are more specific to our target audience. I also gained a more effective understanding of how to combine design with actual interaction from the perspective of the user (rather than from the perspective of the development designer), taking into account the experience and feedback during the user interaction.
