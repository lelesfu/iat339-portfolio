                <h3>UX research & development, Programming</h3>
                <p>Help a user to learn about abstract art by “moving
                through time” to reveal the process of making an
                individual artwork, and its historical context.</p>
                <br>
                <p>This is an interactive installation that helping the target user to understand the meaning behind the“abstract art” through the process of making it and what it conveys through history.  The initial inspiration came from the personal experience of our professor taking his son to visit the art gallery. His son believed that the abstract art works in the gallery were simple, and it was completely meaningless to evaluate them. We realized that this was a problem caused by the lack of interactivity, so we made a design goal of making an interactive installation that is both interesting and substitutable to help our target population (the youth / people without artistic background) understanding the meaning behind abstract art in an effective and pleasant interaction.</p>

              <h3>User Experience and Live Demo</h3>
              <p>Due to its functional approach,
              everything needs to convey
              meaning and stays away from
              arbitrary. The user should feel
              simple and straightforward while
              interacting with the installation.
              The user is able to have a deeper
              understanding of the art, the way
              artists thinking, and why attract art
              matters.</p>

              <p>We will build in voiceover function in our installation to help the user understand the 
              art piece even better. While different content shows on the screen, both voiceover 
              and subtitle will appear to improve the user acquiring the information. The user will 
              also have options to change the volume, the speech rate, pause/start, etc.</p>

              <h3>Analysis</h3>
              <p>In this project, I was responsible for the technical part and established the OOP connection between Arduino and processing. After completing the code of the basic functions, I encountered some challenges: due to the space and structure of the classroom are completely different from the art gallery, every ultrasonic sensors needs to be tuned for a specific data range. This process required lots of patience and circumspection, and also took me most of the time during the whole project. However, the final result was satisfactory, the threshold and fault tolerance was in perfect ranges.

              In this project, I learned that using technology is indeed a good helper for interactive art, because it provides a richer interaction between the artwork and the user, and conveys the artwork itself also the meaning behind it. I realize attracting more people to notice and think about the art, this is the key to define the benefits of interactive art.
